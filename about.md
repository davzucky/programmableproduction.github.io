# About myself
My name is David and I have more than 20 years of experiences mainly on windows and .Net. The past few year I have been involve with some startup to provide them some help and I rediscover Linux which will be cover here. At the same time they are some interesting topic that were happining in the community like Docker, Continous deployment which passion me.
Working at the moment in a large bank, whihc has a lot of process and where experiencing new technology is hard, I feel that it's time for me to learn and explore more what is happening outside of the corporate world in the open source community.
